Welcome to my personal website!

I work as an analyst at [Ancine](https://www.gov.br/ancine/pt-br), the regulatory body for audiovisual in Brazil, and study economics at PUC-Rio.

My current research focuses on economics of regulation, and cultural and audiovisual policy, with an Industrial Organization slant.
