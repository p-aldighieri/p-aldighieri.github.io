I work as an analyst at [Ancine](https://www.gov.br/ancine/pt-br), the regulatory body for audiovisual in Brazil, and study [economics at PUC-Rio](http://www.econ.puc-rio.br/).

My current research focuses on economics of regulation, cultural and audiovisual policy, with an Industrial Organization slant.
