## Welcome!

I recently finished my master's in economics at [PUC-Rio](http://www.econ.puc-rio.br/) and will be joining [Northwestern Economics](https://economics.northwestern.edu/) as a PhD candidate this fall (2022).

I currently work as an analyst at [Ancine](https://www.gov.br/ancine/pt-br), the regulatory body for audiovisual in Brazil

My research interests focus on economics of regulation, cultural and audiovisual policy. My current research fields are applied micro and Industrial Organization.
